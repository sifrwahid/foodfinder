foodfinder
==========

The Food Finder	was created by the Healthy Affordable Food Alliance (HAFA) of Washington, DC in 2008.	

www.dcfoodfinder.org

It was a relatively quick project made several years ago and modifications have been made over time.	

The Food Finder uses the Google Maps API and Zoho. The Zoho database is maintained by HAFA. 

Eventually the format of the Zoho database format should be documented and support for other data sources should be added.

Each city or project should have its own fork, so eventually this will become the generic master and the dcfoodfinder will be a forked.
